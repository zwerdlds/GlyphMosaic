# GlyphMosaic
## What is GlyphMosaic?
GlyphMosaic is a graphic design program which re-creates images using glyphs.  In essence, it is supplied a bitmap (source image) and a body of text.  With additional parameters, it uses the color values in the source image to place glyphs from the text.

This project will eventually be a usage demonstrator for the [Roopes](https://docs.rs/roopes/) crate.
It is currently predominantly centered on design documentation rather than implementation.
