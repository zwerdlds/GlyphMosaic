\end{itemize}


\section{Requirements}
Requirements for GlyphMosaic aim to create a responsive and productive environment for its users.
The GlyphMosaic System provides a specialized method to build unique graphic mosaic designs.


\subsection{Functionality}
GlyphMosaicâ€™s main built-in functionality is focused entirely on the workflow of creating mosaics.
In the most common workflow, a user will load source image and source text into the program, adjust various settings and bitmaps to their needs, render a high-resolution version of the output mosaic, and then save that file for use outside the application.

\subsection{Differentiation}
Existing systems perform a similar, but limited subset, of functionality of the system.
Textaizer\cite{textaizer}, for example, has the ability to specify various line patterns, such as spirals.
Many other examples exist that focus solely on LTR horizontal mosaics.

GlyphMosaic does not have these limitations.
The creator is able to specify the glyph line pattern by specifying a region line kernel for each region.
The system then determines a text path which encompasses the entire region, and develops a

\label{sec:usecases}

\begin{itemize}
  \lbodyitem{System Installation}{
  \item Users should be able to download, install, and run the system on their own devices.

\section{System Qualities}{
  \label{sec:qualityattributes}
  \subsection{Performance}
  Users should be able to rapidly receive feedback representing the current state of the project.
  This includes a preview of the document they wish to create.
  \begin{itemize}
    \pbodyitem{Tactics}{
      \begin{itemize}
        \pbodyitem{Cacheing}{
          Throughout the image creation pipeline, certain modules may not necessarily produce different output, given a user's input.
          Recomputing these results is wasteful, and avoided by implementing a cacheing layer available to other modules in the system.
          This method involves trading future computational load for memory space.
        }
        \pbodyitem{Profiling}{
          Architects of the system utilize system profiling on typified workloads to determine bottlenecks in performance.
          These bottlenecks are then examined and the system is revised to eliminate it.
        }
      \end{itemize}
    }
    \pbodyitem{Scenarios}{
      \begin{itemize}
        \pbodyitem{Region Drawing}{
          When a user draws a region mask on the preview pane, the system should display a preview of the mask within one tenth of a second.
          \lidiagram{../diagrams/scenarios/region-drawing}
          {GlyphMosaic gives near-instantaneous feedback for region specification.}
          {fig:sc-reg-draw}
        }
        \pbodyitem{Mosaic Preview "Cold" Response}{
          When a user opens the preview pane, it should display a preview of the mosaic within one second.
        }
        \pbodyitem{Mosaic Preview "Warm" Response}{
          When a user changes a parameter in the document while the preview pane is already open and viewing a result of that change, the user should see the result of that change within one quarter of one second.
        }
        \pbodyitem{Mosaic Full Render Response}{
          When the user triggers a full render of the document, the system should write the result to the host filesystem within 20 seconds.
        }
      \end{itemize}
    }

\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Drivers}
\begin{itemize}
  \lbodyitem{Design Purposes}{
    \pbodyitem{Modeling a Specialized Workflow}{
      The system is designed to facilitate a specific graphic design workflow.
      This workflow follows an interative approach, like most graphic design workflows, in which a document would be created and modified in successive phases until the designer is content with the result.
      At this point, the designer indicates to the system that the image should be rendered at high-resolution for output and consumption by other systems.

\subsection{Styles and Patterns}
GlyphMosaic communicates with clients using standardized web technologies.

\textbf{Monolithic}

\textbf{Layered}
The system builds functionality in layers.


\textbf{Pipe/Filter}


\textbf{Model-View-Controller}


\textbf{Event Bus}


\subsection{Rationales}
A few of the most enabled qualities include:

\begin{itemize}
  \pbodyitem{Performance}{}
  \pbodyitem{Maintainability}{}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alternative Architectures}

\begin{itemize}
  \pbodyitem{Distributed Computing}{
    Breaking up components of GlyphMosaic into services could enable more computational resources to be added to the system.
    % However, it is still the case in this implementation that updates must be done all at once: the system is still unitary.

    % The typical use of load-balancers and in-memory caches which large-scale deployments employ may be interpreted as an application of this approach.

    % Narrowing the focus to the GlyphMosaic system, there are two main reasons why it may not be preferential to implement this approach:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %   \pbodyitem{Complexity}{
    %     Breaking up the monolithic internal structure of the system into components would require substantial refactoring.
    %     Plug-Ins, represent a substantial barrier: Hooks must be registered centrally, so would need to be resolved somehow.
    %     Without involving complex voting protocols, this alone would still represent a single point of communication.
    %     Additionally, the state of the system can be queried at the time that a hook is activated, demanding complete synchronization between all nodes.

    %     It may be possible for templates to be distributed since their outputs should be idempotent.
    %     In practice, however, since they are capable of executing arbitrary PHP, they would probably encounter similar issues to plug-ins.
    %   }

    %   \pbodyitem{Diminishing Returns of Scale}{
    %     While performance on GlyphMosaic may not be superior to other platforms, most users do not encounter traffic sufficient to demand the scalability provided by SOA or microservice architectures.
    %   }
    % \end{itemize}

    % In conclusion, the monolithic model is ``good enough'' compared to a service-oriented architecture.
    % The main reason this approach is unlikely to have advantages for system stakeholders is the diminishing returns to scale those stakeholders will perceive.
  }
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}
% A three-tier architecture provides several benefits to the GlyphMosaic system, but it also comes with some limitations that can affect certain quality attributes.
% Developers and organizations need to consider these limitations when designing and implementing their systems to ensure they meet their requirements and objectives.
% Proper planning, design, and testing can help mitigate these limitations and ensure a successful implementation.
% A few drawbacks to consider include:
% \begin{itemize}
% \pbodyitem{Performance}{
%   Performance limitations can occur due to the communication overhead between the layers.
%   Network latency and message passing can add to the overall response time of the system, leading to slower performance.
% }
% \end{itemize}

  % \section{User Roles}
  % \label{apx:userroles}
  % GlyphMosaic implements an hierarchical RBAC modeling a CMS workflow.
  % The user-accessible functions of a GlyphMosaic system are broken down into roles\cite{WpDocRolesCapabilities}, with each mostly having one essential function.
  % Single users are given a role by an administrator or super-admin.
  % The architecture's capabilities are broken out by permission level.
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \pbodyitem{Super-Admin} {
  %     Manage site networks.  Super-admins can create sites and also have the ability to manage plugins, themes, and users across all sites in the site network installation.  Super-Admin abilities are a superset of Admins.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Admin} {
  %     Admins are site-level users responsible for managing plugins, themes, and other users at the site level.  Admin abilities are a superset of Editors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Editor} {
  %     Editors are responsible for managing pages or comments written by other users.  Editor abilities are a superset of Authors.

  %   \pbodyitem{Author} {
  %     Authors can create and manage their own posts.  Author abilities are a superset of Contributors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Contributor} {
  %     Contributors are capable of creating content but are not allowed to publish it directly, necessitating interaction with an editor or author-enabled user.  Contributor abilities are a superset of Subscribers.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Subscriber} {
  %     Subscribers can edit a profile which is used when leaving comments.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Web User} {
  %     Unauthenticated users can access content which has been published by Authors.  This role is not explicitly enumerated by the default configuration.
