\subsection{Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
  \pbodyitem{Output Image consumers}{Individuals who view or request graphic design produced by the system.}
  \pbodyitem{Developers}{Individuals responsible for producing the system as described in this document.}
  \pbodyitem{Graphic Designers}{Individuals who produce graphic designs using the system.}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Overview of Requirements}
Requirements for GlyphMosaic aim to create a responsive and productive environment for its users.
The GlyphMosaic System provides a specialized method to build unique graphic mosaic designs.


\subsubsection{Functionality}
GlyphMosaicâ€™s main built-in functionality is focused entirely on the workflow of creating mosaics.
In the most common workflow, a user will load source image and source text into the program, adjust various settings and bitmaps to their needs, render a high-resolution version of the output mosaic, and then save that file for use outside the application.


\subsubsection{Use Cases}
\label{sec:usecases}

\begin{itemize}
  \lbodyitem{System Installation}{
  \item Users should be able to download, install, and run the system on their own devices.
        }

\section{System Qualities}{
  \label{sec:qualityattributes}
  \subsection{Performance}
  Users should rapidly receive feedback representing the current state of the project.
  \begin{itemize}
    \pbodyitem{Tactics}{

      % \begin{itemize}
      %   \pbodyitem{Module Cohesion}{
      %     Internally, the structure of the system follows a highly module design.
      %     Each module is broken up into fewer than approximately 15 internal components, with more complex modules being subdivided further.  See \prettyref{sec:decomp}.
      %   }
      %   \pbodyitem{Binding Deference}{
      %     The plug-in subsystem categorizes bindings in twain: actions and filters\footnote{This division of event types can also be viewed as a form of encapsulation.}.
      %     Plug-ins can dynamically register for each based on strings at runtime.
      %     In this way, events are bound at-will by plug-ins, allowing them to have as much complexity as necessary, while also preserving system speed at a reasonable level.
      %   }
      %   \pbodyitem{Encapsulation}{
      %     The system encapsulates extensible behavior into three categories:
      %     \begin{itemize}
      %       \pbodyitem{Templates}{
      %         Strictly speaking, GlyphMosaic templates represent the per-page formatting using HTML\footnote{Colloquially, themes and templates are conflated, with the term ``theme'' essentially encapsulating both.}.
      %         Because they control the root file for the page a user is viewing in their browser, this gives nearly limitless control to template developers to modify content.
      %         Templates can be attached by types, tags, taxonomies, categories, and authors.
      %         Modifying a template does not necessitate modifying the actual content presented in the page.

      %         Templates are further composed of template blocks.  See \cite{wpBlocks}.
      %       }
      %       \pbodyitem{Themes}{
      %         Themes are, effectively, groups of template files, and can modify the style of an entire site.
      %         This enables users to modify their entire site with a single add-on.
      %         E.g.: a theme developer could package a number of templates, images, CSS files, and audio into a single theme and distribute it for use by site administrators.

      %         The default installation of GlyphMosaic includes a number of themes, named by year of development.  See \cite {wpThemes}.
      %       }
      %       \pbodyitem{Plug-Ins}{
      %         Plug-ins represent the ultimate extension of the system.
      %         Using plug-ins, a developer can hook into arbitrary actions and events, and alter the incoming data (through filters) or execute arbitrary code based on events (actions) the system fires.  Writing plug-ins requires knowledge of PHP, but installing existing plug-ins does not.
      %       }
      %     \end{itemize}
      %   }
      % \end{itemize}
    }
    \pbodyitem{Scenario}{
      % To make a previously built theme easier for GlyphMosaic users to use, a GlyphMosaic plug-in developer updates it, the modification is done successfully and available forÂ useÂ less than twoÂ hours after the update with no downtime.

      % {GlyphMosaic has a streamlined process to adding plug-ins.}
      % {fig:modqas}

      % \begin{itemize}
      %   \item Source of stimulus: Plug-in Developer
      %   \item Stimulus: Updates a theme
      %   \item Artifact: GlyphMosaic theme
      %   \item Environment: Normal operation (after deployment)
      %   \item Response: Modification is done successfully

\subsection{Styles and Patterns}
GlyphMosaic communicates with clients using standardized web technologies.

\textbf{Monolithic}

\textbf{Layered}
The system builds functionality in layers.


\textbf{Pipe/Filter}


\textbf{Model-View-Controller}


\textbf{Event Bus}


\subsection{Rationales}
A few of the most enabled qualities include:

\begin{itemize}
  \pbodyitem{Maintainability}{}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alternative Architectures}

\begin{itemize}
  \pbodyitem{Distributed Computing}{
    Breaking up components of GlyphMosaic into services could enable more computational resources to be added to the system.
    % However, it is still the case in this implementation that updates must be done all at once: the system is still unitary.

    % The typical use of load-balancers and in-memory caches which large-scale deployments employ may be interpreted as an application of this approach.

    % Narrowing the focus to the GlyphMosaic system, there are two main reasons why it may not be preferential to implement this approach:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %   \pbodyitem{Complexity}{
    %     Breaking up the monolithic internal structure of the system into components would require substantial refactoring.
    %     Plug-Ins, represent a substantial barrier: Hooks must be registered centrally, so would need to be resolved somehow.
    %     Without involving complex voting protocols, this alone would still represent a single point of communication.
    %     Additionally, the state of the system can be queried at the time that a hook is activated, demanding complete synchronization between all nodes.

    %     It may be possible for templates to be distributed since their outputs should be idempotent.
    %     In practice, however, since they are capable of executing arbitrary PHP, they would probably encounter similar issues to plug-ins.
    %   }

    %   \pbodyitem{Diminishing Returns of Scale}{
    %     While performance on GlyphMosaic may not be superior to other platforms, most users do not encounter traffic sufficient to demand the scalability provided by SOA or microservice architectures.
    %   }
    % \end{itemize}

    % In conclusion, the monolithic model is ``good enough'' compared to a service-oriented architecture.
    % The main reason this approach is unlikely to have advantages for system stakeholders is the diminishing returns to scale those stakeholders will perceive.
  }
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}
% A three-tier architecture provides several benefits to the GlyphMosaic system, but it also comes with some limitations that can affect certain quality attributes.
% Developers and organizations need to consider these limitations when designing and implementing their systems to ensure they meet their requirements and objectives.
% Proper planning, design, and testing can help mitigate these limitations and ensure a successful implementation.
% A few drawbacks to consider include:
% \begin{itemize}
% \pbodyitem{Performance}{
%   Performance limitations can occur due to the communication overhead between the layers.
%   Network latency and message passing can add to the overall response time of the system, leading to slower performance.
% }
% \end{itemize}

  % \section{User Roles}
  % \label{apx:userroles}
  % GlyphMosaic implements an hierarchical RBAC modeling a CMS workflow.
  % The user-accessible functions of a GlyphMosaic system are broken down into roles\cite{WpDocRolesCapabilities}, with each mostly having one essential function.
  % Single users are given a role by an administrator or super-admin.
  % The architecture's capabilities are broken out by permission level.
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \pbodyitem{Super-Admin} {
  %     Manage site networks.  Super-admins can create sites and also have the ability to manage plugins, themes, and users across all sites in the site network installation.  Super-Admin abilities are a superset of Admins.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Admin} {
  %     Admins are site-level users responsible for managing plugins, themes, and other users at the site level.  Admin abilities are a superset of Editors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Editor} {
  %     Editors are responsible for managing pages or comments written by other users.  Editor abilities are a superset of Authors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Author} {
  %     Authors can create and manage their own posts.  Author abilities are a superset of Contributors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Contributor} {
  %     Contributors are capable of creating content but are not allowed to publish it directly, necessitating interaction with an editor or author-enabled user.  Contributor abilities are a superset of Subscribers.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Subscriber} {
  %     Subscribers can edit a profile which is used when leaving comments.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Web User} {
  %     Unauthenticated users can access content which has been published by Authors.  This role is not explicitly enumerated by the default configuration.
  %   }
  % \end{itemize}
