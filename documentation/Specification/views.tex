    \subsection{Top-Level System}
    The system interacts with the following aspects of the host system:
    \begin{itemize}
      \pbodyitem{Filesystem}{
        The system reads source images and text from the host filesystem.
        \Glspl{out_image} are written to the host filesystem.
        \Glspl{document} are read and written to the host filesystem.
      }
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Modules}
    \label{sec:modules}
    The system is composed of the following top-level modules:
    \begin{itemize}
      \pbodyitem{UI}{
        The user interface manages the frontend of the system.
        In particular, it manages the state of the UI.

        The UI module publishes the following data:
        \begin{itemize}
          \pbodyitem{Region Parameters}{
            When a region parameter is updated by a user, the UI module is responsible for forwarding that change to the remainder of the system.
          }
          \pbodyitem{Direct \gls{bitmap} Manipulation}{
            The user may draw on the canvas to modify \glspl{path_dilation_mask} or \glspl{glyph_path_kernel}.
          }
          \pbodyitem{File Save}{
            The user may specify a location from which a \gls{document} or \gls{out_image} can be saved.
          }
          \pbodyitem{File Load}{
            The user may specify a location from which a \gls{document}, \gls{src_img}, or \gls{src_txt} can be loaded.
          }
        \end{itemize}
        The UI must also reflect when a relevant change is made to the internal system, to allow the user to view that change.
        These changes are also forwarded to the document management system to ensure the change is reflected when the document is exported.
      }
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Data Flows}
    \label{sec:dataflows}
    Data flows between each module in such a way as to accomplish the workflow set forth in \prettyref{apx:algorithm}.
    This process somewhat mirrors the components described in \prettyref{sec:modules}, but also describes the relationships necessary to update the user interface and document.
