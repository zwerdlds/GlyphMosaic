    \subsection{Top-Level System}
    The system interacts with the following aspects of the host system:
    \begin{itemize}
      \pbodyitem{Filesystem}{
        The system reads source images and text from the host filesystem.
        Output images are written to the host filesystem.
        Application documents are read and written to the host filesystem.
      }
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Modules}
    \label{sec:decomp}
    The system is composed of the following top-level modules:
    \begin{itemize}
      \pbodyitem{UI}{
        The user interface manages the frontend of the system.
        In particular, it manages the state of the UI.

        The UI module publishes the following data:
        \begin{itemize}
          \pbodyitem{Region Parameters}{
            When a region parameter is updated by a user, the UI module is responsible for forwarding that change to the remainder of the system.
            
          }
          \pbodyitem{Bitmap Draw Events}{
            The user may draw on the canvas to modify a region mask or a path line kernel.
          }
          \pbodyitem{File Save}{
            The user may specify a location from which a file must be saved.
          }
          \pbodyitem{File Load}{
            The user may specify a location from which a file must be loaded.
          }
        \end{itemize}
        The UI must also reflect when a relevant change is made to the internal system, to allow the user to view that change.
        These changes
      }
    \end{itemize}
