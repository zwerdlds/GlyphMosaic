\subsection{BitMap}
Bitmaps are 2-dimensional arrays of arbitrary-dimension pixels.
Sub-bitmap pixels are of arbitrary dimensions due to their varied use: In some contexts, they are representative of 3-channel RGB images, while others are simply binary maps, which are used in successive processes to build the \index{Output Image}output image.

The universal facade with which other systems can interact with this module is \bmftype.
These methods are forwarded directly to a referenced \bmctype.
It exposes the following functionality:
\begin{itemize}
    \pbodyitem{Creation}{
        Client code may `check-out' \bmtype\space objects.
        These are potentially recycled heap objects.
    }
    \pbodyitem{Destruction}{
        Client code may `check-in' \bmtype\space object with which it has no more use.
        These objects will be `washed' once they are `checked-out' once again.
    }
\end{itemize}

The following types are also members of this module, but probably shouldn't be used directly.  Instead, client code should access functionality through \bmftype:
\begin{itemize}
    \component{BitMapBuilder}{BitMapBuilder}{
        Provides type-safe incremental construction of \bmtype s.
    }
    \component{BitMap}{BitMap}{
        Stores data relevant for the individual matrices.
    }
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{}
Bitmaps are used in the following exterior components:
\begin{itemize}
    \bitmaparea{Output Image}{Output Image}{3}{}
    \bitmaparea{Parameters!Source Image}{Source Image}{3}{}
    \bitmaparea{Parameters!Glyph Path Kernel}{Glyph Path Kernel}{1}{}
    \bitmaparea{Glyph Path}{Glyph Path}{1}{}
    \bitmaparea{Glyph Path Kernel}{Glyph Path Kernel}{1}{}
    \bitmaparea{Path Dilation Mask}{Path Dilation Mask}{1}{}
\end{itemize}
