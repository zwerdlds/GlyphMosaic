\subsection{Document}
The document namespace contains interfaces concerned with the state of a document's user-mutable fields.
This includes publishers, subscribers, and visitors.
The module is centered around three enums, each representing different specificity for the event types.

The facade is strictly concerned with creating publishers of the various levels of specificity, for use in other modules.
No other types are implemented locally: that is left to each of the other submodules such that

\subsubsection{Mechanics}
A \docsftype\ is created from a \docsfftype\ by client code in the root of the application.
The \docsftype\ that is passed into users of \docmod\ as a \docftype\ for further use.

Each \docftype\ supposes a single active document at a given time.
I.e: each document window should have a single attached \docftype.

\subsubsection{Usage}
\docftype\ is responsible for providing an interface for registering agents responsible for handling changes to the active document.
This type is instantiated and referenced by other subsystems at startup.
Those subsystems can register their agents to be notified as \docpctype\ events are propagated by other subsystems.
\docpctype\ events are propagated by passing them to the \docftype .\texttt{propChangeSub} subscriber.
