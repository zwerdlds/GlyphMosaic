\subsection{Document}
The document namespace contains logic concerning the state of the persisted document.
This sub-system listens for the application to change parameters of the document, and persists them.
Additionally, when a program document file is loaded, it will send notifications to subscribed components.

\subsubsection{Usage}
% \dftype\ is also used to register for document changes for usage outside of this system:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \docarea{GUI}{GUI}{The GUI subsystem must listen for all field changes so that they are accurately displayed in the interface.}
%     \docarea{Lines}{Lines}{
%         The Lines subsystem listens for per-region parameters which affect that region's lines.  These include the following:
%         % \begin{itemize}
%         %     \extparamref{PathDilationMask}{PathDilationMask}
%         %     \extparamref{GlyphPathKernel}{GlyphPathKernel}
%         %     \extparamref{GutterLineHeight}{GutterLineHeight}
%         %     \extparamref{LineHeight}{LineHeight}
%         %     \extparamref{PathGenerationScale}{PathGenerationScale}
%         % \end{itemize}
%     }
% \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Mechanics}
The \dmod\ facade is responsible for registering agents responsible for handling changes to the active document.
Internal usage of this includes \dffspcstype\ struct, which listens for parameters to change, and writes them to a file.
Alternatively, in the case of the system being built for a WASM\index{Web Assembly} target, however, this listener will not be registered.
Instead a \dflspcstype\index{Local Storage} listener will have the ability to write to the browser's storage.
