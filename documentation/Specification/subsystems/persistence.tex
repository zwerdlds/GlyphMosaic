\subsubsection{Mechanics}

\subsubsection{Usage}
In general, the subsystem functions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Save \\
            Write the current state of the document to a serialized location.
            If the file does not already have an associated location and needs one\footnote{This need is target-specific.} this will prompt the user to select a location (TODO: the method with which this is implemented is tbd).
      \item Save As \\
            Write the current state of the document to a serialized location to a specific location.
      \item Load \\
            Taking a path argument, publish the necessary parameter changes to recreate the deserialized document at that location.
            This propagates all parameters to the \docftype.
\end{itemize}
