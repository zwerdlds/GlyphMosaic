\subsection{Persistence}
The \permod\ subsystem is responsible for ensuring \docdtype\ events are written to platform-appropriate storage.
\permod\ will, depending on the target, write to a specific store:
\begin{itemize}
      \item File System: SQLite-based binary file.
      \item WASM: Browser-based local storage.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mechanics}
\perftype\ subscribes to \docmod\ events via that subsystem's \docftype subscriber features.

\subsubsection{Usage}
In general, the subsystem functions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
      \item Save \\
            Write the current state of the document to a serialized location.
            If the file does not already have an associated location and needs one\footnote{This need is target-specific.} this will prompt the user to select a location (TODO: the method with which this is implemented is to be determined).
      \item Save As \\
            Write the current state of the document from a serialized location to a specific location.
      \item Load \\
            Taking a path argument, publish the necessary parameter changes to recreate the deserialized document at that location.
            This propagates all parameters to the \docftype.
\end{itemize}
