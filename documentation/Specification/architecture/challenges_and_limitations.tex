\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}
\subsubsection{Performance}
The system requires computational power to produce result images.
Specifically, the large number of individual glyphs represent a potential scaling issue.
In addition, the large bitmaps the system may interact with may also contribute to performance degradation.
