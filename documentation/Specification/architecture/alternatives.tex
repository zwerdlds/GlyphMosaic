    \label{sec:alt_dist_comp}
    Breaking up components of GlyphMosaic into services could enable more computational resources to be added to the system.
    In the future, it may be beneficial to implement a networked architecture to enable the system to scale horizontally and improve responsiveness.
    A distributed approach will need to consider the following aspects:
    \begin{itemize}
      \pbodyitem{File Transfers}{
        Preview and rendered images may be large.
        Operating on bitmaps in memory is substantially faster than over a network.
        Performance profile comparisons between implementations will need to show a clear benefit to this approach before full integration.
      }
      \pbodyitem{Complexity}{
        Interacting with remote compute nodes introduces complexity to the system which is not related to the core functionality of the system.
        Adding, removing, and sending data will all need distinct components to provide a hygienic solution, which will require additional engineering effort.
      }
