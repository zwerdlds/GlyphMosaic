\subsection{Top-level Pattern}
The application is implemented at the top level as a set of separate subsystems which interact in decoupled ways with each other, via facades that define their exposed behavior.
Within each subsystem, designers have the freedom to structure each as necessary.
This enables approaches that permit rapid responses to user input, preserving the performance goals of the application.

Each subsystem's patterns are defined in \prettyref{sec:subsystems}.
