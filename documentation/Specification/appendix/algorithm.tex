\section{Algorithm}
\label{apx:algorithm}
This section details the process followed to deterministically produce a given mosaic.
It assumes that all top- and region-level parameters have already been specified.
This is a high-level description of the process: it does not include any implementation-specific aspects of the system.

\begin{deepEnum}
  \item Calculate each glyph's information (GI):
        \begin{deepEnum}
          \item Generate concentric text paths.
                For each region:
                \begin{deepEnum}
                  \item Collect active glyph path kernel pixels (\akp s).
                  \item Calculate the number of text lines (\ntl) necessary to generate the path:
                        \begin{deepEnum}
                          \item Find the point in the mask which is furthest from all active glyph kernel pixels (\(MP\)), and the closest AKP to that pixel (\akpc).
                          \item Divide the distance between the MP and \akpc\space by the line height, giving \ntl.
                        \end{deepEnum}
                  \item Create \(i\) in \ntl\space paths:
                        \begin{deepEnum}
                          \item For pixel \(p\) in AKPs:
                          \begin{deepEnum}
                            \item Draw a circle of radius \(i * LH\) around each AKP
                          \end{deepEnum}
                        \end{deepEnum}
                \end{deepEnum}
        \end{deepEnum}
  \item Render the glyphs.
\end{deepEnum}
