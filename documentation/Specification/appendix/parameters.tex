\section{Mosaic Parameters}
\label{apx:userparams}
The process of developing mosaics necessitates user manipulation of the following parameters to ensure correct output:
\begin{itemize}
  \pbodyitem{Font}{
    \index{Font}
    The specific glyph set used when stamping glyphs in the rendered image.
  }
  \pbodyitem{Source Image}{
    Used to calculate pixel sizing.
  }
  \pbodyitem{Source Text}{
    Used to determine which glyph is placed at the successive locations.
  }
  \pbodyitem{Regions}{
    When a region is added, it is `empty' in that it will not allow any glyph points to be added to the output image.
    Removing a region is a cascading delete - all parameters associated with the region are also removed.

    Each region maintains a set of additional parameters which determines the rendered glyphs:
    \begin{itemize}
      \pbodyitem{Mask}{
        A 1-channel bitmap representing the area for which glyph points will be considered valid.
        This can be thought of as the effective area of the region.
      }
      \pbodyitem{Glyph Path Kernel}{
        A 1-channel bitmap representing the seed of the dilated layers which are then used to generate the region text path.
      }
      \pbodyitem{Line Height}{
        The distance between the lines of text on which glyphs are placed.
      }
      \pbodyitem{Glyph Kerning}{
        The fixed distance between each glyph.
      }
      \pbodyitem{Glyph Minimum Size}{
        The smallest size glyphs are scaled to.
        This corresponds to the size a glyph would be generated from by encountering a white pixel at its point.
      }
      \pbodyitem{Glyph Maximum Size}{
        The largest size glyphs are scaled to.
        This corresponds to the size a glyph would be generated from by encountering a black pixel at its point.
      }
    \end{itemize}
  }
\end{itemize}
