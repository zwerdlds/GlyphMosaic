\section{Requirements}
Requirements for GlyphMosaic aim to create a responsive and productive environment for its users.
The GlyphMosaic System provides a specialized method to build unique graphic mosaic designs.


\subsection{Functionality}
GlyphMosaicâ€™s main built-in functionality is focused entirely on the workflow of creating mosaics.
In the most common workflow, a user will load source image and source text into the program, adjust various settings and bitmaps to their needs, render a high-resolution version of the output mosaic, and then save that file for use outside the application.


\subsection{Differentiation}
Existing systems perform a similar, but limited subset, of the functionality of the system.
Textaizer\cite{textaizer}, for example, can specify various line patterns, such as spirals.
Many other examples exist that focus solely on LTR horizontal mosaics.

GlyphMosaic's pathing is \gls{bitmap}-based, using \glspl{glyph_path_kernel} instead.
Mosaic creators can specify the glyph line pattern by specifying a region line kernel for each region.
The system then determines a text path that encompasses the entire region, and stamps glyphs from the \gls{src_txt} along the \gls{glyph_path}, scaling according to the \gls{density} from the \gls{src_img} to arrive at the \gls{out_image}.

\subsection{Use Cases}
\label{sec:use_cases}

\begin{itemize}
      \lbodyitem{System Installation}{
      \item Users should be able to download, install, and run the system on their own devices.
            }
            \lbodyitem{Content Creation}{
      \item Users should be able to create and modify GM documents.
            }
\end{itemize}

This workflow is further detailed in \prettyref{sec:user_workflow_model}.
