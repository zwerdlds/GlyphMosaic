  % GlyphMosaic implements an hierarchical RBAC modeling a CMS workflow.
  % The user-accessible functions of a GlyphMosaic system are broken down into roles\cite{WpDocRolesCapabilities}, with each mostly having one essential function.
  % Single users are given a role by an administrator or super-admin.
  % The architecture's capabilities are broken out by permission level.
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \pbodyitem{Super-Admin} {
  %     Manage site networks.  Super-admins can create sites and also have the ability to manage plugins, themes, and users across all sites in the site network installation.  Super-Admin abilities are a superset of Admins.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Admin} {
  %     Admins are site-level users responsible for managing plugins, themes, and other users at the site level.  Admin abilities are a superset of Editors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Editor} {
  %     Editors are responsible for managing pages or comments written by other users.  Editor abilities are a superset of Authors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Author} {
  %     Authors can create and manage their own posts.  Author abilities are a superset of Contributors.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Contributor} {
  %     Contributors are capable of creating content but are not allowed to publish it directly, necessitating interaction with an editor or author-enabled user.  Contributor abilities are a superset of Subscribers.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Subscriber} {
  %     Subscribers can edit a profile which is used when leaving comments.
  %   }

  %   \pbodyitem{Web User} {
  %     Unauthenticated users can access content which has been published by Authors.  This role is not explicitly enumerated by the default configuration.
  %   }
  % \end{itemize}
